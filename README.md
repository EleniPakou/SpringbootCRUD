# SpringbootCRUD

In the springbootcrud-client folder execute: npm install
After the install is complete, execute: npm run dev (the file would be huge otherwise...)
The application will then run at  http://localhost:9000

I expanded the original application to include the Supplier entity (I did not delete the Person entity - both are working)

The tables in the database are empty
